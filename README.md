Seattle

I got into Seattle on Sunday and spent the afternoon hanging out with my cousin Zach. I was just happy to be out of Portland, and to stay somewhere for free for the first time in a month. I spent most of the week going into the Seattle Galvanize and having a weird sort of domestic partner relationship with my uncle. It was fun but I was very ready to be back in Denver.
